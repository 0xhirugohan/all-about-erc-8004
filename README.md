# All About ERC-8004

## Motivation

[ERC-8004 created in August 2025](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004), which is just recently. If you look at it, in short, it extends [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) by Google. ERC-8004 itself enable what A2A is lacking off, which is a trustless agentic network. Because A2A assumes that its running in a trustful agentic network within their own ecosystem. Which then ERC-8004 enables much more than a trustless agentic network, but also the agentic-economic.

I am currently participating in [Trustless Agent (ERC-8004) Colearning](https://intensivecolearn.ing/en/programs/trustless-agents) that is co-hosted by LXDAO and ETHPanda. Most of the resources are actually there. But there are some resources that is not there, but I am not sure if I should add it or not. So thus I add them on my own repository here.

The ERC-8004 contracts are designed to be singleton. One ERC-8004 contract deployed on each chain. No need to deploy more ERC-8004 contract in the same chain. The official contracts repository is [here](https://github.com/erc-8004/erc-8004-contracts). Currently there are only 4 testnets supported. And I plan to keep them easily trackable through a simple web gui.
